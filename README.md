# Multimodal_attention_DeepLearning

The multi-modal deep learning algorithm was developed to predict the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. This model was combined with the attention mechanism to create the final model (multi-modal deep learning with intra- and inter-modality attention modules: MDL-IIA)

* tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0
* numpy 1.19.2
* pandas 1.2.4
* scikit-image 0.18.1
